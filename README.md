## How to use this image

To run [Haraka] mail server just start the container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 25:25 instrumentisto/haraka
```


### Configuration

By default, image uses default configuration files in `/etc/haraka/config/` directory. To use a custom configuration file you should mount it:
```bash
docker run -d -p 25:25 \
           -v /path/to/my/smtp.ini:/etc/haraka/config/smtp.ini:ro \
       instrumentisto/haraka
```


### Plugins

__Note!__ Once you've installed [Haraka plugins][1], do not forget to enable them in `/etc/haraka/config/plugins` file.

#### NPM packaged

[NPM packaged plugins][2] can be easily installed via `HARAKA_INSTALL_PLUGINS` environment variable. Specify it as comma-separated [NPM] packages, and the container will run `npm install` on its startup:
```bash
docker run -d -p 25:25 \
           -v /path/to/my/plugins:/etc/haraka/config/plugins:ro \
           -e HARAKA_INSTALL_PLUGINS=haraka-plugin-rcpt-postgresql,haraka-plugin-auth-enc-file@1.0 \
       instrumentisto/haraka
```

#### Legacy

Legacy custom plugin files may be mounted directly into `/etc/haraka/plugins` directory:
```bash
docker run -d -p 25:25 \
           -v /path/to/my-awesome-plugin.js:/etc/haraka/plugins/my-awesome-plugin.js:ro \
           -v /path/to/my/plugins:/etc/haraka/config/plugins:ro \
       instrumentisto/haraka
```

#### [Alpine][11] packages

Some plugins (like [`tls`][3]) may require additional system libraries being installed. Use `APK_INSTALL_PACKAGES` environment variable to pre-install them on container startup:
```bash
docker run -d -p 25:25 \
           -v /path/to/my/plugins:/etc/haraka/config/plugins:ro \
           -e APK_INSTALL_PACKAGES=openssl \
       instrumentisto/haraka
```




## Image tags

This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project][11], available in [the alpine official image][12]. Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.

This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc][13] instead of [glibc and friends][14], so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread][15] for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.


### `X`

Latest tag of `X` [Haraka]'s major version.


### `X.Y`

Latest tag of `X.Y` [Haraka]'s minor version.


### `X.Y.Z`

Latest tag version of a concrete `X.Y.Z` version of [Haraka].


### `X.Y.Z-nodeA-rN`

Concrete `N` image revision tag of a [Haraka]'s concrete `X.Y.Z` version installed with `A` major version of [Node.js].

Once build, it's never updated.
